## About
`tic-tac-toe` is a command line version of the eponymous paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with Xs or Os. The winner is the one who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.[^1]

## Self Reflections
- > This project felt like more of a headache than [the previous ones](https://github.com/ohgrmait). The introduction and considerable use of OOP (object oriented programming) throughout this project made it harder for me to complete it. On top of that, the project specifications provided very little scaffolding so this was the very first project where I had to think on what entities would qualify for good classes and instance methods. I also had to do quite a bit of error handling to make sure the user input was clean and appropriate. Overall, it was a very satisfying experience which made me more confident in my newly obtained OOP sea legs.
